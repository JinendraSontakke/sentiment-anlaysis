I really want to like this app but it has several shortcomings (either it doesn't provide these things or provides them but they are so hidden and/or so undocumented that I could never figure out how to do it): (1) no way to create a route out of existing trails. There is a loop I like to do but in the app this loop is 3 separate trails. No way I could see to join them into a loop so as to get stats (e.g. total distance of the loop) (2) even on a given single trail in the app, the best it seemed to do is show me the blue dot for where I was. That's quasi-useful but what I really wish it would show is things like how far to the destination? How far have I come so far? What elevation gain/loss has happened so far, or how much on the trail ahead?. Somewhat disappointed.",2,18,21.14.0,2021-08-08 23:10:16,,
